In this question we will try to explore a simple example that can combine the two approaches. Consider a very basic neural network with just two inputs, $x_1$ and $x_2$, and a single neuron which computes $y = \\sigma(w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2)$, where $\\sigma$ is the logistic sigmoid $\\sigma(a) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-a}}$. In other words, we are just referring to a standard logistic regression model. Further suppose that we have a data set with $N$ points $D = \\{(x_{11}, x_{12}, t_1); (x_{21}, x_{22}, t_2); ... (x_{N1}, x_{N2}, t_N)\\}$, where $t_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is the true output for data point $i$. As usual in logistic regression, we will interpret the model output $y$ as the probability that the actual output is 1, i.e., $p(t_i = 1|x_{i1}, x_{i2}) = y(x_{i1}, x_{i2})$.",
    "transcript": "Okay, next is question 8 on this essay topic. So, in this course we've discussed two major types of cognitive modelling approaches: Bayesian and connectionist, or neural network models. Now, let's explore a simple example that combines these two approaches. Consider a very basic neural network with just two inputs, x one and x two, and a single neuron which computes y equals sigma, w zero plus w one times x one plus w two times x two, where sigma is the logistic sigmoid function, sigma of a equals one over one plus e to the negative power of a. In other words, we're just referring to a standard logistic regression model. We have a data set with N points, D, equals the set of pairs, open parenthesis, x sub 11, comma x sub 12, comma t one close parenthesis, comma open parenthesis, x sub 21, comma x sub 22, comma t two close parenthesis, and so on, up to N one, comma N two, comma t N. And in this data set, ti is equal to zero or one, which represents the true output for each data point i. As usual in logistic regression, we'll interpret the model output y as the probability that the actual output is one, or p of t i equals one, given x i one and x i two.\n\nNow, let's move on to combining these two approaches."
